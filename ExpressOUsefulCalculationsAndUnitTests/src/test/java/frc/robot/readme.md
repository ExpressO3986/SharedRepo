If unit tests doesn't show, do these 2 steps:
    1- In VSCode's Extension manager, install "Test Runner for Java" from Microsoft.
    2- The code editor's menu bar, click View -> Command Palette. Select ">Java: Clean Java Language Server Workspace", then click "Reload and delete" on the bottom-right pop-up menu.
Now you can see and launch unit tests under Testing tab to the right, below the Entensions tab.
